# Factorial-Calculator
This is a Java program that calculates the factorial of a list of integer input values. The program uses exception handling to ensure that only valid input is processed and throws a custom exception when the input value is out of range. The program includes a factorial() method that uses a for loop to calculate the factorial of the input number.

# Exceptions
The program uses exception handling to ensure that only valid input is processed. The program throws a custom exception, MyExcep, when the input value is less than 1 or greater than 10. The program also handles NumberFormatException that might occur when a command line argument cannot be parsed as an integer.

# Method
The factorial() method uses a for loop to calculate the factorial of the input number. The method initializes the result to 1 and then iteratively multiplies the result by each integer value up to and including the input number.
