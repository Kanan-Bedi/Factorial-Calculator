# Factorial-Calculator
This is a Java program that calculates the factorial of a list of integer input values. The program uses exception handling to ensure that only valid input is processed and throws a custom exception when the input value is out of range. The program includes a factorial() method that uses a for loop to calculate the factorial of the input number.
